##Overview

The Portfolio Kanban Board app helps you track the status of your portfolio items as they move along in your portfolio process. You must have Rally Portfolio Manager enabled in your subscription to add the app to your Rally menus.

Each portfolio item is displayed as its own card on the Kanban board. Each card displays the ID, Name, Owner, and % Done by Story Count. If a portfolio item has not been assigned a state, it displays in the No Entry column.
